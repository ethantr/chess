Look, I dunno, I just like chess and wanted to have fun building what is essentially my first personal project as an undergrad student.

Basically my first major dive into Javascript, CSS, HTMl. The basics. I've been using it before, but never properly felt somewhat comfortable at a basic level to apply it.

This was a fun project in teaching me the logic of a chess game, the logic behind what is a valid move for the pieces, UI design. The whole lot. I think I'll just keep it open to have fun with really.
